## Introduction to Cerebral Plasticity
* Synaptic Plasticity
* Intrinsic Plasticity

### Synaptic Plasticity
#### Synapse
* Efficiency / Intensity
* Duration 

Therefore Long Term Potentiation or Long Term Depression and similiarly Short Term...
#### Hebbian Learning
(It was a proposition, not proven) 
When an axon of cell j repreatedly or persistently...
- local rule
- simultaneaously active (correlations)

Weaknesses :

Problems of **stability** becasue of infinite weight growth

Possible measures : 
 - Bound (but saturation) dw_{ij}/dt = n * v_{i} * v_{j} (w_{max} - w_{ij})
 - Normalization (spatial competetion between synapses )
 
 Bidirectional Hebbian Rule (Gerstner and Kistler 2002) - both increase and decrease of weights
 - Postsynaptic gating (Kohenen)
  * postsynaptic term controls intensity of learning
  * presynaptic term controls the sign
 - Presynaptic gating
  
 BCM Rule (Bienenstock, Cooper, Munro, 1982)
